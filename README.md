# sprint-4-project

This is a practice project mainly made for the purpose of improving the creator's proficiency with a number of programming tools. Plotly.express and streamlit feature heavily to present the project and show the charts used in it. A fair amount of code was unused, but left in for the sake of showing my work and thought processes for the project.

Other modules used are Pandas and Altair

This project can be run on a local machine by cloning the repository and running app.py through streamlit.
